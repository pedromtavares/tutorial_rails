This is an online store application that has been used as an example for my Rails Learning Experience: http://pedromtavares.wordpress.com/

This application implements:
 - A catalog showing all available products.
 - An AJAX-based shopping cart.
 - An order checkout system.
 - A simple administration system with restricted access, user and product management.
 - A simple web-service providing XML feed.

There are 3 main sections in this application:
 - The buyer's side, which is implemented by the StoreController.
 - The administrator's side, which is implemented by the AdminController along with the LoginController and the authorize method in the ApplicationController.
 - The simple web service, which is implemented by the InfoController.
